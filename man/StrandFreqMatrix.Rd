\title{A class for storing a matrix of frequencies of Watson to Crick reads
for a set of contigs over several libraries}
\description{
\describe{
 The strand information stored in this object is the ratio of Watson to Crick reads
 mapping to each contig in each library (cell). This should fall within the range (-1,1).
This class simply extends matrix, but with additional validity checking.
