\item{allStrands}{table of strand calls for all contigs}

\item{lg}{numeric value defining which linkage groups}

\item{method}{algorithm to order the contigs}

\item{contigWeight}{optional order in which to place contigs using greedy algorithm}

\item{linkageGroup}{vector of names of contigs in this linkage group to try to order}
}
\value{
list of two members: 1) contig names in order, 2) contigs that were combined due to being zero-distance from each other
