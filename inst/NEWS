contiBAIT v0.99.1
===============
-fixed orientation issue with ideogramPlot. Now accepts OrientationTable to flip Watson and Crick reads.
-fixed intermediate issue in mergeLinkageGroups where rownames were sometimes maintained and sometimes not after computeconsensus resulting in melt error.
-preprocessStrandTable no longer looks for sex chromosomes. Was mostly pointless and didn't work well. Better method is to look for linkage groups with computeConsensus where consensus is mostly homozygous.
-fixed reorientLinkageGroups where second iteration after mergeLinkageGroups was overwriting the OrientationTable.  Now accepts a previousOrient argument if performing second reorientation.
removed sex.contig argument from makeBoxPlot as redundant
